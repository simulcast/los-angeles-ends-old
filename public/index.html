				<p>isaac and i are driving back from shatto lanes in my dad’s sedan. it’s 1am and we want tacos al pastor. we’re stopped at the red light going north on western, in the left turn lane waiting for the green. as the light on sunset turns from yellow to red, a car sserves through the intersection and smashes the driver-side door. they speed away, pushing off the side panel. we’re left frozen, turn signal blinking off the taco truck sign.</p>
				<p>the cops come, see my <a href="http://www.lamag.com/longform/the-zankou-chicken-murders/" target="_blank">zankou</a> t-shirt, and ask if i work there. they like the shawarma.</p>

I was in post-traumatic shock, but also in a form of culture shock. Shards of glass kept coming out of my skin, rising to the surface like diamonds that couldn’t be digested by the flesh. There was too much sunshine, everything was too clean, colors were too bright. I kept trying to see Los Angeles as if it were Hollywood in black and white."</i></p>

				<p>december 2016 and the sun, set but still glowing over glendale, radiates off the hood of my car. a pulsating orange rips through the sky, indexing every time i’ve seen los angeles play the apocalypse’s backdrop.</p>
				<p>i think about childhood nightmares of nuclear bombs exploding on the horizon, of knowing the end is soon and near but not right now or quite yet here. i think about <i>miracle mile</i>, a movie that my parents showed me when i was too young, where missiles come flying over the santa monica mountains and land in the la brea tar pits. i think about the episode of 24 where jack bauer cries as a mushroom cloud rises over valencia.</p>
				<p>sunset in los angeles always confuses the day’s end and the end of days.</p>

				<p><i>“It is hard for people who have not lived in Los Angeles to realize how radically the Santa Ana figures in the local imagination. The city burning is Los Angeles’s deepest image of itself; Nathanael West perceived that, in </i>The Day of the Locust<i>; and at the time of the 1965 Watts riots what struck the imagination most indelibly were the fires. For days one could drive the Harbor Freeway and see the city on fire, just as we had always known it would be in the end. Los Angeles weather is the weather of catastrophe, of apocalypse... the violence and the unpredictability of the Santa Ana affect the entire quality of life in Los Angeles, accentuate its impermanence, its unreliability. The wind shows us how close to the edge we are.”</i></p>

				<p>i have a nightmare that plays every month where i’m sitting atop elysian park. i can see a third of the playing field at dodger stadium, and i’ve taken a picnic and a transistor radio to follow the game. santa ana winds cool the air. then i turn my head to the right and watch as the light grows closer, warmer, brighter.</p>
				<p>“i guess that’s it,” i think.</p>

				<p>loss often makes the apocalypse feel like an appealing alternative to life.</p>
				<p>a ripping feeling, being pulled apart, a desire for the end because it might return you to the person who left — the end of the world is deeply personal. no surprise that after my mom died i dreamt repeatedly of los angeles in flames. of it exploding, expanding, ending. i didn't want to live.</p>
				<p>there's something instructive about coming so close to the end and deciding that it's not the way forward. that the world is ending but you are not. on the best days it feels obvious, on the worst it feels like a lie.</p>
				<p>not an explosion, just a tear in two.</p>

			<p>when you're going south on the 110, towards LAX, the carpool lane splits off. it soars, temporarily, along the harbor corridor, two lanes of high velocity and light traffic. then, at the judge harry pregerson interchange, where the 110 intersects the 105, solo drivers take the far right lane in a tight quarter arc from south to west.</p>
			<p>but if you're not alone, if you have a passenger, the two of you can stay left and take flight. banking 15 degrees, it feels as if there's barely any force at all preventing you from taking off, launching, driving up up up into the stratosphere.</p>

	    		<p>in <i>speed</i>, the 1994 keanu reeves vehicle, a bus cannot go any slower than 65 miles per hour or it will explode. it was filmed during the century freeway's construction, and climaxes with the bus jumping a gap between unfinished sections of freeway.</p>

				<p>in the opening sequence of <i>la la land</i>, a musical number stops traffic on the interchange. drivers, frustrated by the traffic, stop their cars and sing. it's a single shot, craning, deeply ambitious cinematography. if you look closely, however, there are some issues.</p>
				<p>1) there is never traffic in the carpool lane on the judge harry pregerson interchange.</p>
				<p>2) cars face the same direction in each of the two sections of the interchange. the group of cars on the left, should they make it out of traffic, will find themselves driving the wrong direction on the 110.</p>
				<p>3) all of these drivers are alone in their cars. do they have LADOT transponders that allow them to pay for the carpool lane? will they face significant city fines?</p>
				<p>the film does not take up any of these questions.</p>

				<p>"To understand what was going on it is perhaps necessary to have participated in the freeway experience, which is the only secular communion Los Angeles has. Mere driving on the freeway is in no way the same as participating in it. Anyone can 'drive' on the freeway, and many people with no vocation for it do, hesitating here and resisting there, losing the rhythm of the lane change, thinking about where they came from and where they are going. Actual participants think only about where they are. Actual participation requires a total surrender, a concentration so intense as to seem a kind of narcosis, a rapture-of-the-freeway. The mind goes clean. The rhythm takes over. A distortion of time occurs, the same distortion that characterizes the instant before an accident."</p>

	    		<p>on the judge harry pregerson interchange, time distorts. i've driven it only with others — with friends, coming to and leaving los angeles; with partners, visiting me to see what i called home; with my parents, dropping me off and letting me go.</p>
				<p>driving home from LAX, in a loose communion with the other solo drivers on the 105, i feel intense loneliness. i merge to the right lane, take the unexciting ramp, and wind my way towards whatever feels like home.</p>
