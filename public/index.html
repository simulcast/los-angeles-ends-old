		    	<p>summer 2017 and i’m in town for my dad’s wedding.</p>
		    	<p>it’s the night before i return to providence, track this record, and pack up my things. i’ve decided to move back to LA.</p>
				<p>isaac and i are driving back from shatto lanes in my dad’s sedan. it’s 1am and we want tacos al pastor. we’re stopped at the red light going north on western, in the left turn lane waiting for the green. as the light on sunset turns from yellow to red, a car serves through the intersection and smashes the driver-side door. they speed away, pushing off the side panel. we’re left frozen, turn signal blinking off the taco truck sign.</p>
				<p>the cops come, see my <a href="http://www.lamag.com/longform/the-zankou-chicken-murders/" target="_blank">zankou</a> t-shirt, and ask if i work there. they like the shawarma.</p>

				<p><i>"So there I was in critical condition with a serious head injury until, as mysterious as it still seems, I returned from comatose near-death to what could only be described as near-life in LA. I was in post-traumatic shock, but also in a form of culture shock. Shards of glass kept coming out of my skin, rising to the surface like diamonds that couldn’t be digested by the flesh. There was too much sunshine, everything was too clean, colors were too bright. I kept trying to see Los Angeles as if it were Hollywood in black and white."</i></p>

				<p><i>"I recuperated at my partner’s family home, one of those capacious Hancock Park houses surrounded by palm trees but designed to look like a Tudor cottage in the Cotswolds. On the other side of the backyard hedge, I was told, was the house from </i>Sunset Boulevard<i>... The back hedge of the house in </i>Sunset Boulevard<i> was now a place where the dog barked at night as if he were calling across the lawns to ghosts that swam there thousands of nights before. </i>Sunset Boulevard<i> was just as far and just as close as it had ever been."</i></p>

				<p>a dream of falling daylight</p>
				<p>underneath the orange glow so familiar in los angeles</p>
				<p>as a cloud blooms on the horizon</p>
				<p>i hear baseball on the radio</p>
				<br>
				<p>this is the light that will take us with it</p>
				<br>
				<p>a warm breeze in from the desert</p>
				<p>with an exhale, i try to let go</p>

				<p>december 2016 and the sun, set but still glowing over glendale, radiates off the hood of my car. a pulsating orange rips through the sky, indexing every time i’ve seen los angeles play the apocalypse’s backdrop.</p>
				<p>i think about childhood nightmares of nuclear bombs exploding on the horizon, of knowing the end is soon and near but not right now or quite yet here. i think about “miracle mile,” a movie that my parents showed me when i was too young, where missiles come flying over the santa monica mountains and land in the la brea tar pits. i think about the episode of 24 where jack bauer cries as a mushroom cloud rises over valencia.</p>
				<p>sunset in los angeles always confuses the day’s end and the end of days.</p>

				<p><i>“It is hard for people who have not lived in Los Angeles to realize how radically the Santa Ana figures in the local imagination. The city burning is Los Angeles’s deepest image of itself; Nathanael West perceived that, in The Day of the Locust; and at the time of the 1965 Watts riots what struck the imagination most indelibly were the fires. For days one could drive the Harbor Freeway and see the city on fire, just as we had always known it would be in the end. Los Angeles weather is the weather of catastrophe, of apocalypse... the violence and the unpredictability of the Santa Ana affect the entire quality of life in Los Angeles, accentuate its impermanence, its unreliability. The wind shows us how close to the edge we are.”</i></p>
				<p>– Joan Didion, <i>Slouching Towards Bethlehem</i> (1968)</p>

				<p>i have a nightmare that plays every month where i’m sitting atop elysian park. i can see a third of the playing field at dodger stadium, and i’ve taken a picnic and a transistor radio to follow the game. santa ana winds cool the air. then i turn my head to the right and watch as the light grows closer, warmer, brighter.</p>
				<p>“i guess that’s it,” i think.</p>
				<p>i wake up in a sweat. it's my fault — it wouldn’t have happened if i hadn’t looked.</p>

			<div class="essay">
				<p>loss often makes the apocalypse feel like an appealing alternative to life.</p>
				<p>a ripping feeling, being pulled apart, a desire for the end because it might return you to the person who left — the end of the world is deeply personal. no surprise that after my mom died i dreamt repeatedly of los angeles in flames. of it exploding, expanding, ending. i didn't want to live.</p>
				<p>there's something instructive about coming so close to the end and deciding that it's not the way forward. that the world is ending but you are not. on the best days it feels obvious, on the worst it feels like a lie.</p>
				<p>not an explosion, just a tear in two.</p>
