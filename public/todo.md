#website to-do

vermaland doesn't fit because it takes you out of the narrative of the record. takes focus off of grief / off of writing achingly specifically about loss. los angeles ends is a good track 2 bc it literally explodes those thing in a commic way and the essay explains that. and then hov/horizon/almost right. whoof what a run! leaves room for the next batch of incoming songs. blue (dfn), oncoming, back to school, station fire etc. and the interactive pieces / radio collages!!!!

tape with noah should be for the first 5 songs in los angeles ends. side a ttw through almost right. side b freeway ambients with full samples and vermaland. no blue. small run tape only.
