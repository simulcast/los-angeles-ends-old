1. format essay for lae

swap lyrics to second slide and video to first
make iframe not capture keyboard??
experiment with parallax on / fading instead of swiping

maybe vermaland is not part of los angeles ends? figure out what else to do with it. it can be single just not part of that playlist. and then the documentary... it's a one-off with that.
change through the windshield lyrics to not be about quartzsite but about sunset and western. this is so bonkers clear. and then los angeles ends is a brilliant and sinister track 2.

vermaland doesn't fit because it takes you out of the narrative of the record. takes focus off of grief / off of writing achingly specifically about loss. los angeles ends is a good track 2 bc it literally explodes those thing in a commic way and the essay explains that. and then hov/horizon/almost right. whoof what a run! leaves room for the next batch of incoming songs. blue (dfn), oncoming, back to school, station fire etc. and the interactive pieces / radio collages!!!!

tape with noah should be for the first 5 songs in los angeles ends. side a ttw through almost right. side b freeway ambients with full samples and vermaland. no blue. small run tape only.
