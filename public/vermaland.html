				<p>in spring 2015, my dad and i drive out to glendale, arizona to see the dodgers play the white sox in spring training. the game is at camelback ranch, resplendent green with a creek tumbling into waterfall over smooth stone. the water feature spans 5 acres and has been stocked with fish.</p>
				<p>on camelback road, just outside the complex, we pass over the agua fria river, which has run completely dry.</p>

				<p>moving west on the 10 from phoenix to los angeles, you hit the edge of urban development long before you hit the edge of the grid. roads sprawl outwards as the avenues count into the mid-triple digits. camelback road ends at 507th avenue in tonopah — the grid finally stops at 579th.</p>
				<p>tonopah’s land parcels are large, empty, and sun-baked. they have neither irrigation nor power. large banners line the highway advertising <a href="http://www.vermaland.com/" target="_blank">vermaland</a>, a real-estate development company that has bought up much of maricopa county. founded by kuldip verma in 2001, the company owns 25,000 acres of undeveloped desert. at some point, capitalism will find it more profitable to fund solar energy than fossil fuels. when the scale tips, vermaland will be there to cash in.</p>

				<p><i>“Today, even though the Colorado still resembles a river only in its upper reaches and its Grand Canyon stretch... it is still unable to satisfy all the demands on it, so it is referred to as a ‘deficit’ river, as if the river were somehow at fault for its overuse. And though there are plans to relieve the ‘deficit’ – plans to import water from as far away as Alaska – the twenty million people in the Colorado Basin will probably find themselves facing chronic shortages, if not some kind of catastrophe, before any of these grandiose schemes is built – if, indeed, one is ever built.</p>
				<p>One could almost say, then, that the history of the Colorado River contains a metaphor for our time.”</p></i>

				<p>in tonopah we feel the sun beat down.</p>
				<p>the highway ahead narrows to a point on the horizon, tarmac blurred by the heat. my dad and i drive, listen to music, and count upwards with each passing avenue.</p>
				<p>endless power lines the end.</p>
